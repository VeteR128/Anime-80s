            Few subgenres of sci-fi could be more titillating than one that
            fuses urban, dystopian, and technological themes to the point that
            they’re almost figuratively symbiotic.

          <p class="header__paragraph">
            After all, Cyberpunk often tackles what most genres couldn’t.

          <p class="header__paragraph">

            With technology advancing left and right, offering slow & systematic
            changes in how our society functions as a whole, it’s only natural
            to wonder just where we’d end up in the near future.

          <p class="header__paragraph">
            And these ideas can be easily expressed in Anime.

                For the hard-earned title of “The Best”, Akira comes out at the
                top after a painfully long consideration. Sure, anyone could
                make a case that any others could deserve to be here. But I’m
                certain that none of them are as much of a stark representation
                of what the word ‘cyberpunk’ really is. Akira is, after all, the
                very first manga series dedicated solely to the cyberpunk genre.
                On the other hand, its anime series also further popularized the
                genre for the years to come. To this day, even. All in all, the
                godfather of all cyberpunk anime is absolutely worth a watch –
                and for good reason.

                From Mamoru Oshii of “Ghost in the Shell” fame, we receive this
                deceptively simple story: A young girl wanders through a dark,
                empty city inhabited only by the ghosts of the past, both human
                and animal. She carries with her a massive egg, which she
                protects and nurtures. Soon a man appears and begins to follow
                her. Much of the movie is without dialogue. That doesn't sound
                terribly inviting, but it is what it is: An ominous and
                slow-moving film that, while requiring a degree of patience, is
                nonetheless quite lovable.

                Metropolis is…a silent film from 1927 by the German director
                Fritz Lang. It’s set in a dystopian future where some naive
                teenager tries to overcome the class system to pursue love.
                Metropolis is…a manga written in 1949 by Osamu Tezuka. Its
                similarities to the original film are pretty limited, mainly
                because Tezuka hadn’t even seen the film when he wrote the
                manga. He’d only seen a single picture in a magazine and thought
                it looked pretty rad.

                Let’s dive into the realm of dreams with Paprika. It’s a surreal
                and thought-provoking anime film that both satisfies and
                entertains, all while making you pick your brain at times. The
                story introduces the concept of how technology affects us, and
                essentially changes our perception of dreams and reality. It’s
                all wrapped in a neat yet adult-oriented package that, once
                again, I could only recommend for older audiences. What makes
                this anime stand out is the chilling ambiguity of its imagery
                and storytelling – so much so that it’s hard to actually put it
                into words. It’s much like Inception, for example. Years later
                and there are still wars waged online as to what the spinning
                top at the end of that movie meant. In the end, it intends to be
                just as it is. A movie that’s naturally vague and mind-bending.
                After all, it is a film about dreams. And dreams, well, they’re
                not exactly one of the most explainable concepts there is.

                Closing in on the top of our ranking, we have Ghost in the
                Shell. Quite honestly, it’s the only other title that made this
                ranking extremely hard for me. I’d imagine it would be the same
                for most anime fans as well, I’d imagine. After all, it’s not
                that hard to see why this anime spans across several mediums.
                It’s just that good. It has animated movies, OVAs, an anime
                series, books, heck it even has a live-action remake starring
                Black Widow herself for the main role! If you’ve never looked
                into Ghost in the Shell, definitely give it a try.

                This cyberpunk series offers an anime with an extra emphasis on
                ‘punk’. Set in the faraway future of 2808, Cyber City Oedo 808
                is no doubt a wild and rambunctious watch – in all the good
                ways. Led by a cast of three convicted felons with hundreds of
                years of jail sentences to their names, they’re forced to
                cooperate with one another to become the do-gooders to lessen
                their jail time. It’s a premise that’s not necessarily unheard
                of. But its three colorful and entirely unique main characters
                (along with the high stakes that drive the story) are more than
                enough to grab anyone’s attention. After all, what could drive
                up the tension more than an old-fashioned high school battle
                royale-style exploding collars?

              <p class="cards__text item">
                For this spot we have Serial Experiments Lain — an anime that’s
                heavily driven by philosophical concepts, just like most titles
                in the cyberpunk genre. For a story that starts with an in-depth
                overtly complex exposition of the plot from the get-go, it
                eventually wraps up satisfyingly by the end. And it does this in
                a way that more than makes up for the headaches you might have
                had during its runtime. With it being a title that features
                almost every dark/controversial theme there is, this anime is
                certainly one I would not recommend for everyone. But I
                definitely would recommend it for the more mature anime fans
                that long for a truly great cyberpunk series.

                Featuring one of the most well-known and intricately written
                female leads in anime, it should not be surprising that Battle
                Angel Alita made it this high up in the list. It’s further
                strengthened by phenomenal writing and brilliant storytelling
                that tells us the tale of Alita, the main cyborg waif— I mean
                protagonist of the series. If you’ve watched and enjoyed its
                live-action remake that was released just last 2019, then I
                strongly recommend you watch the anime series as well. After
                all, the original material is (without a doubt) better than the
                movie in most aspects.
