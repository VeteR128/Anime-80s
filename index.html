            Few subgenres of sci-fi could be more titillating than one that
            fuses urban, dystopian, and technological themes to the point that
            theyre almost figuratively symbiotic. After all, Cyberpunk often
            tackles what most genres couldnt.

                  For the hard-earned title of “The Best”, Akira comes out at
                  the top after a painfully long consideration. Sure, anyone
                  could make a case that any others could deserve to be here.
                  But Im certain that none of them are as much of a stark
                  representation of what the word cyberpunk really is. Akira is,
                  after all, the very first manga series dedicated solely to the
                  cyberpunk genre. On the other hand, its anime series also
                  further popularized the genre for the years to come. To this
                  day, even. All in all, the godfather of all cyberpunk anime is
                  absolutely worth a watch – and for good reason.

                  From Mamoru Oshii of “Ghost in the Shell” fame, we receive
                  this deceptively simple story: A young girl wanders through a
                  dark, empty city inhabited only by the ghosts of the past,
                  both human and animal. She carries with her a massive egg,
                  which she protects and nurtures. Soon a man appears and begins
                  to follow her. Much of the movie is without dialogue. That
                  doesn't sound terribly inviting, but it is what it is: An
                  ominous and slow-moving film that, while requiring a degree of
                  patience, is nonetheless quite lovable.

                  Metropolis is…a silent film from 1927 by the German director
                  Fritz Lang. Its set in a dystopian future where some naive
                  teenager tries to overcome the class system to pursue love.
                  Metropolis is…a manga written in 1949 by Osamu Tezuka. Its
                  similarities to the original film are pretty limited, mainly
                  because Tezuka hadnt even seen the film when he wrote the
                  manga. Hed only seen a single picture in a magazine and
                  thought it looked pretty rad.

                <h2 class="cards__title item-text">Paprika</h2>
                <p class="cards__text">
                  Let’s dive into the realm of dreams with Paprika. Its a
                  surreal and thought-provoking anime film that both satisfies
                  and entertains, all while making you pick your brain at times.
                  The story introduces the concept of how technology affects us,
                  and essentially changes our perception of dreams and reality.
                  Its all wrapped in a neat yet adult-oriented package that,
                  once again, I could only recommend for older audiences. What
                  makes this anime stand out is the chilling ambiguity of its
                  imagery and storytelling – so much so that its hard to
                  actually put it into words. Its much like Inception, for
                  example. Years later and there are still wars waged online as
                  to what the spinning top at the end of that movie meant. In
                  the end, it intends to be just as it is. A movie thats
                  naturally vague and mind-bending. After all, it is a film
                  about dreams. And dreams, well, theyre not exactly one of the
                  most explainable concepts there is.

                <p class="cards__text">
                  Closing in on the top of our ranking, we have Ghost in the
                  Shell. Quite honestly, its the only other title that made this
                  ranking extremely hard for me. Id imagine it would be the same
                  for most anime fans as well, I d imagine. After all, its not
                  that hard to see why this anime spans across several mediums.
                  Its just that good. It has animated movies, OVAs, an anime
                  series, books, heck it even has a live-action remake starring
                  Black Widow herself for the main role! If you ve never looked
                  into Ghost in the Shell, definitely give it a try.

                <p class="cards__text">
                  This cyberpunk series offers an anime with an extra emphasis
                  on ‘punk’. Set in the faraway future of 2808, Cyber City Oedo
                  808 is no doubt a wild and rambunctious watch – in all the
                  good ways. Led by a cast of three convicted felons with
                  hundreds of years of jail sentences to their names, they re
                  forced to cooperate with one another to become the do-gooders
                  to lessen their jail time. It s a premise that s not
                  necessarily unheard of. But its three colorful and entirely
                  unique main characters (along with the high stakes that drive
                  the story) are more than enough to grab anyone s attention.
                  After all, what could drive up the tension more than an
                  old-fashioned high school battle royale-style exploding
                  collars?

                <p class="cards__text">
                  For this spot we have Serial Experiments Lain — an anime that
                  s heavily driven by philosophical concepts, just like most
                  titles in the cyberpunk genre. For a story that starts with an
                  in-depth overtly complex exposition of the plot from the
                  get-go, it eventually wraps up satisfyingly by the end. And it
                  does this in a way that more than makes up for the headaches
                  you might have had during its runtime. With it being a title
                  that features almost every dark/controversial theme there is,
                  this anime is certainly one I would not recommend for
                  everyone. But I definitely would recommend it for the more
                  mature anime fans that long for a truly great cyberpunk
                  series.

                <p class="cards__text">
                  Featuring one of the most well-known and intricately written
                  female leads in anime, it should not be surprising that Battle
                  Angel Alita made it this high up in the list. It s further
                  strengthened by phenomenal writing and brilliant storytelling
                  that tells us the tale of Alita, the main cyborg waif— I mean
                  protagonist of the series. If you ve watched and enjoyed its
                  live-action remake that was released just last 2019, then I
                  strongly recommend you watch the anime series as well. After
                  all, the original material is (without a doubt) better than
                  the movie in most aspects.
